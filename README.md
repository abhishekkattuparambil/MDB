# MDB Training Program Mini-Projects

# MDBMemberTrivia

MDB Member Trivia allows users to quickly learn the names of current MDB members through a sort of trivia game. A picture of an MDB member will appear, and the user has 5 seconds to match the face with the correct name. If time runs out or the user guesses wrong, their score is reset to 0.

# Pokedex

The pokedex allows users to sort through hundreds of pokemon and filter them by types, name, or statistics. There's a mini-game in the search bar which will ask the user questions and if they respond correctly (by typing in the full name of the pokemon), it will prompt a new question. Advanced filtering can be done by clicking the "advanced" button, and users can see details of pokemon by clicking on their names in the original view.
